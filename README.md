# Visualizing Path Search Algorithms with Pygame
This project allows users to visualize different path search algorithms such as A* on a 2D grid, using the Pygame library.
## Controls 
- Left Mouse Button: Place/Remove Wall
- Right Mouse Button: Place End
- Middle Mouse Button: Place Start
- Key "d": Search Maze using Dijkstra
- Key "a": Search Maze using A*
- Key "c": Clear Searched Path
- Key "r": Reset Maze
## Usage
To run the program, simply run the main.py file in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
python main.py
```
## Requirements
